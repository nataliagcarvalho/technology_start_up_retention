# Technology Start-Up Retention

***

This is a project from the Laboratoria & IBM Certification.

The idea of this project is to analyze a dataset that contends data from clients that use a cloud expense management software. The main goal is to help the Startup's CEO determine if she is supposed to use the new received investiment to "improve the product" or to grow the company, expanding and achieving more clients. 

In order to answer the business questions and help the stakeholders to take decisions,  I had to understand the dataset and to do an exploratory analysis. To find out if the Startup had achieved the Product-Market Fit, it was necessary to do a cohort retention analysis.

# Product-Market Fit

The Product-Market Fit (PMF) is to determine if the product had already found a faithful space at the market. When the business achives the PMF, it means that it has already its loyalt customers, the clients search for the product by their own because they want and need to.

"The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it -- or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers. Money from customers is piling up in your company checking account. You're hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can." 
(Marc Adreessen, founder of Netscape, the first internet brownser)

# Retention Cohort Analysis

Cohort is a group of people that share similar characteristics during a specific period of time (for example, user that visit a website for the first time, number of people that has downloaded an app, etc.). With this kind of analyze, it's possible to understand the clients' behavior during the specific time like how many of them kept using the product after 3 days, after 1 week and so; if the clients answer better to a week sale or a month sale and all this kind of questions.

Using the cohort analysis, it's possible to find the % retention of clients. In other words, how many of these new clients keep using the product for x time?

So with this monthly dataset, I did a dinamyc table to see monthly the new clients's number in order to find this % retention.
